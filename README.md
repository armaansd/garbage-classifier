## Features:
In order to accomplish this we created an application that allows your camera to classify the recycling items. Aside from classifying the object for you, you can also compete with your friends by classifying different examples of trash to be recycled. Friendly competition is introduced through its leaderboard and the different examples are pulled from a dataset. Through repetitive examples you can learn which items belong in the trash bin and which belong to the recycling bin. Lastly through this constant feedback we can help introduce new images into the dataset that are hard to classify and have the help of its users improve the model.
